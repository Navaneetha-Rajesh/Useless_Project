# WandTunes üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Navaneetha Rajesh


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Navaneetha Rajesh - Govt. Model Engineering College, Thrikkakara


### Project Description
WandTunes is a Harry Potter-themed music player where users cast spells like accio and lumos to control music and themes, and a magical spell book.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Muggle music apps lack the charm of Hogwarts! Why swipe or tap when you can cast spells to summon tunes?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
WandTunes lets you control music with Harry Potter spells! Type accio to summon a song, lumos for a light theme, or avada kedavra to silence the player.
